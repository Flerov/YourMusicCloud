# YourMusicCloud
Tired of paying money for streaming services? I got your back. 

Recently my friend kicked me out of his spotify premium family.
So I decided to make my own music cloud. Feel free to use it or to expand this project.

You can run this programm from your raspberry pi or on another server.

This programm provides a web server which starts on adress: 127.0.0.1 (localhost) and port: 8082

You will see an input box in which you can submit your song. Which will automatically be downloaded from youtube with a cover.
Submit your request in the following format in the input box
single song : this song - this artist
multiple songs: this song - this artist.that song - that artist.this song - that artist
(seperate each song with a dot (.) followed by the next song name)

in further updates you will also be able to provide youtube/spotify playlist links and youtube/spotify song links
