# YourMusicCloud
Tired of paying money for streaming services? I got your back. 

This app is build on top of flask and uses spotify-dowloader to easily download spotify tracks over youtube

This is a alpha version that I have made for fun and without any planing! So the code structure could definitly be better.
There will also come many futures.

What you currently can: 
+ Submit a spotify track link in the following format> 'spotify:track:<someuid>' (You can get that link from spotify)
  That track will asynchroniously be downloaded and added to your standard 'Music' folder
+  All the futures provided by 'spotify-downloader' (most have to come in further updates)
  
What you will be able to do after I update this repository:
+ Submit a song and artist name to get the song
+ Submit a album and artist name to download the whole album
+ Submit a youtube playlist link to get them songs
+ Submit a spotify playlist link to get them song
